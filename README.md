# Evolution-in-CPP
"A comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in C++. Featuring optimized solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by topic with complexity analysis."
# DSA-Vault

My personal collection of Data Structures and Algorithms problems solved in C++. This repo serves as a central hub for my logic building and interview preparation.

## 📂 Folder Structure
- **Arrays/**: Linear data structure problems.
- **Strings/**: Pattern matching and manipulation.
- **Searching-Sorting/**: Binary search, Merge sort, etc.
- **LinkedLists/**: Singly, Doubly, and Circular.
- **Trees-Graphs/**: Hierarchical and networked data.
- **Dynamic-Programming/**: Optimization problems.

## 🚀 How to use
Each file is a standalone C++ solution. I include the problem link and the Time/Space complexity in the comments at the top of each file.
## IMPORTANT NOTES.
1. Use boolalpha to print true or false instead of 1 and 0.
